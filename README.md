# sales_time_series_forecasting

The file "Time Series Data.xlsx" contains sales data for one of the products from the consumer goods company, spanning four years from June 2018 to June 2022. Utilize this dataset, "Time Series Data.xlsx," to develop a sales forecast model extending up to December 2023, on a monthly basis.

This project encompasses the entire process of time series forecasting, which includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify characteristics and verify statistical properties of the time series data. It also involves modeling the time series data, fitting and validating it using an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, and evaluating the model's performance.
